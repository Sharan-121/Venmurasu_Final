Saudi continued, "A Brahmin is in the throat of the vessel with his wife
The throat of the bird like the flame of the flame
He is in the hand, "The best of O Brahmins, when you open my mouth, quickly exit when you open my mouth.
Whatever a Brahmin is involved in the sinful deeds, he is not killed by me
The Brahmin said, "Oh, my wife, my wife, my wife, and my wife, will come out with me
Great, "The girl from the nite of the nostrils will come out and get out quickly
Because you are not digested by the heat of my intestine
Saudi continued, "After that, the Brahmanan came out with his wife from the nite nation and praised the root and went on the way
When the Brahmin came out with his wife, the bird was driven by the king and feathers
Then he spoke to him,
That's the great sage leak "Oh baby! Are you fine? Is that the food you need? Do you have a lot of food in the world of humans?"Asked that "the bear," my mother is fine
My Earth and I are the same
But the father, I do not always get enough food so that I do not have peace in my heart
I have been sent by snakes for the amazing elixir
To release my mother from slave, I will definitely be carried out
My mother commanded me to say 'Nishades "
I am thousands of them, but my hunger does not include
Therefore, the praise of oh, I am a lot of food to know the extent of the elite,
Motify my hunger and thirst to fake the appropriate meal. "
Cususist coarse, "You see this lake is very sacred
The goddess is known in the goddess
There is an elephant who pulls the tortoise of the face downwards
I will tell you in detail in the two of the two
Listen to the detail of why they are here
There was a great manner called Velavasur before
He was the most angry
He was a brother that Subradikan
Following the brother was unwilling to keep his wealth with the brother
Subradigan has always been talking about the speech
After some time, Viravasur looked at Subradigan, "The blink of humans on the wealth, humans are a great stupidity
After dividing the inheritance property, the wealth of wealth is fighting each other
People who are in the guise of friends and selfishes between those who are in the guise of friends, and the forms of the flaws are formed, and the conflict is strong, and then one after one
, Complete the spectacle will come very quickly
Because of this, the wise people will not yell the separation of the brothers, and the brothers will leave official laws, one on one
But Subradiga, you will always be in the separation of my advice and want to arrange for your personal wealth so you are the elephant
Cursed Subradigan Viagasur and cursed the answer to the "you and the man who moves in the middle of the water"
Subradigan and Vinelavasur have become the elephant and turquoise respectively because of both wealth,
In their anger with their anger animals
, They are coming to them in their biggest and body weight,
In this lake, the two animals are going to work for their attempts
Here's a beautiful elephant, which is one of them, and this beautiful elephant, right now
The tante with the huge body living in the water is listening to the elephant's split and get out of the lake rude
Looking at the muraches and the elephant flows into her praise and runs into the water
Bring the massive power, and his fathers are blending the water of his faith, tail and feet,
, Lifting his head with great strengths and comes forward to attack
The elephant contains six yojan height and twice the round

Both the two of these people are ready for the attack to kill each other and then fulfill the thing you want
The mountain is like the mountain and the crowd of the army, and bring the elephant,
"Saudi continued," telling the coarse, saying, "When you fight with the gods, you will be blessed
Oh laying race!Foolish and Brahmins, Cows, and other sacred objects bless you
Oh so much!When you fight with the gods, Rick, Yajur, Memories, the sacred flag of the sacrifice, all the puzzles and the Upanishads, and strengthen you,
So he went near the lake, with his father blessed by his father
He saw that clean waterproof birds around the lake
The ravian with great speed of moving, remembering his father's words
Then the bird was flew to the heaven
Reached the sacred space of the Alamer Tirth, and saw many divine trees there
The trees began to shake the trees by the impact of the wind raised by his wings
Those divine trees with gold branches, feared that 'we are breaking down'
Those trees that gives the desired taxes, the vulnerability of the afraid of the scared,
Those giant trees were with gold and silver branches, and precious stones with gemstones
They were cleaned by sea water
While the tree in the trees in the woods there is a great factant tree, while the king of those birds are approaching the pace
The best of the birds and the hilly body, the hundred and the high speed, while sitting in the branch of the ammighter, the branch of the leaves and thousands of wireless organisms fell. "
