"He said," "Indra, the king of the gods, who had the best of the horses on his chariot, after being worshiped like this by the Kadru, hid the sky with blue clouds and said to the Ammas, 'Shoot your holy drops, which cannot give life.'" ""
And the clouds were lightened with lightning, and the sky was filled with rain, one against another, and the sky began to rain, and the clouds were awesome, thunder, and lightening, and the sky appeared as if it were the end of the age.
The rain caused the waves to be accompanied by strong winds, thunder, lightning, and thunder
The entire sky was covered with clouds, and the sun and the moon's rays disappeared completely due to incessant rains.
Snakes were delighted by the rain of Indra
The earth is filled with water, clear and cool water flowing down to the bottom
The earth was surrounded by countless tidal waves
Snakes and their mother reached the island of Rhino.
